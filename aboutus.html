					<p>About Sshrishti</h4><br>
					<p>Source : <a href="#">http://www.sshrishti.org/index.html</a></p>
					<p>SShrishti was conceived as a reaction to the plight of the children of a slum in the neighborhoods. Our effort is to help the underprivileged children who roam on the streets of our city and forage through rubbish to make a few rupees. We believe it is the basic right of every child to get an education to fulfill his potentials and lead a life of dignity. Through our learning centers we wish to reach out to these children and educate them in a joyous and creative atmosphere. We especially want to help the children of the migrant laborers who miss out on regular schooling due to periodic shuttling between their native village and the city.</p>
					<p>Mamta, the property owner is part of the governing body of this organization which won the Rockefeller institute award this year.</p>
